# Coupe / Coupette / Champagne Saucer

Known in cocktail circles as a Coupe, Champagne Saucers are perfect for serving straight-up drinks. Urban myth has it that the original Coupe glass was moulded in the shape of Marie Antoinette's left breast. Sadly, the truth is the glass was invented in England in 1663, long before the reign of the queen. Although I am the proud owner of a pair of Coupes shaped after British model Kate Moss' left breast - but that's another story... .Modern Coupes are widely available but search out vintage examples. Store in a freezer to ensure well chilled prior to use.  
Capacity to brim: 7oz / 20cl
