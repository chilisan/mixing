## How to Dry Shake

Words by Simon Difford

When making drinks containing cream and eggs it is common practice to first shake the mixture without ice, before shaking the drink a second time with ice. This practice is known as ‘dry shaking’ and the theory is that first shaking without ice, and so at a higher temperature, better allows the drink to emulsify producing more aeration and a thicker foam on top of the finished cocktail.

Some bartenders also place a spring from a Hawthorne strainer in the shaker during the first 'dry shake' as this acts as a whisk inside the shaker when the drink is shaken. I find the use of a spring unnecessary.

Dry shaking does indeed produce more foam than conventional shaking with ice. But not as much as 'reverse dry shaking' does. Aristotelis Papadopoulos (Telis to his friends) from Thessaloniki in Greece lays claim to discovering the benefits of this technique.

Combine all your ingredients in the shaker and shake conventionally with ice. Then open your shaker and strain liquid back into the smaller tin (supposing you've followed my advice and use a two-piece shaker). Discard ice left in large tin. Reseal shaker and shake again without ice. Then pour your drink into the glass through a fine strainer to catch any curdled egg and the chalaza (the tissue that connects the yolk to the shell's membrane).
