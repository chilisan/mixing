# Building Method

It is made by pouring the ingredients one by one into the glass in which it is to be served and then stirred. Ice is added if the recipe calls for it.

For example, _Highballs, Rickey, Swizzle, Hot drinks, etc_ are made by this building method cocktail, in which the ingredients are added one by one straight into the glass in which it is served. If ice is required, then it is placed first before adding the ingredients.
