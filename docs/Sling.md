# Sling

Reminiscent of a pilsner beer glass, these tall elegant glasses are perfect for long drinks and can be used in place of a Collins glass. The Sling is named after its own category of cocktails and is most identified with the [Singapore Sling](https://www.diffordsguide.com/encyclopedia/2014-06-16/446/cocktails/singapore-sling).  
Capacity to brim: 11oz / 32cl
