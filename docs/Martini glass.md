# Martini glass
The curvy Coupe has made the angular v-shaped lines of the classic Martini glass look a tad dated but somehow a Martini is not a Martini when served in a rounded glass. A Martini glass should be no bigger than 7oz / 20cl, as a true Martini warms up too much in the time it takes to drink a larger one. Keep Martini glasses in a freezer so they are well chilled before use.  
Capacity to brim: 7oz / 20cl
