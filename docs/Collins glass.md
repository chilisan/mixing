# Collins glass

## Collins

Named after the [Collins](https://www.diffordsguide.com/encyclopedia/2014-08-05/490/cocktails/the-collins-cocktail) cocktail, the name 'Collins' is something of a catch-all term for tall slim straight sided glasses. Not to be confused with the similar, slightly squatter and broader, and importantly smaller, 'hi-ball' glass. A 12oz Collins glass will suffice for cocktails and perfectly accommodates a 330ml bottle of beer or soda. However, many favour the use of larger 14oz glasses.  
Capacity to brim: 12oz - 14oz / 35cl - 41cl
