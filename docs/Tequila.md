# Tequila

Tequila is a distilled spirit made from the agave plant that can only be produced in certain regions of Mexico. There are several styles of tequila and specific regulations that distillers must follow. Tequila is enjoyed globally and is most often consumed in Mexico and the U.S.

## Tequila vs. Mezcal

Mezcal is the name for any distilled spirit made from the maguey (agave) plant. Technically, tequila is a mezcal, but all mezcals are not tequila, similar to how bourbon and scotch are types of whiskey. Both have laws governing their production, though mezcal can use a greater variety of agave grown in nine Mexican states and must be produced in those areas. The most significant difference is in how the agave is prepared. Mezcal distillers traditionally bake the agave in earthen pits, which imparts a noticeable smoky flavor.

Other agave spirits include pulque, sotol, raicilla, and baconara. All are technically mezcals, but each has its own attributes and production methods. Only tequila and mezcal are readily available outside of Mexico. 

## Tequila Categories
Tequila is usually bottled in one of five categories:

- Blanco [ˈblaŋko] ("white") or plata [ˈplata] ("silver"): white spirit, unaged and bottled or stored immediately after distillation, or aged less than two months in stainless steel or neutral oak barrels  
- Joven [ˈxoβen] ("young") or oro [ˈoɾo] ("gold"): unaged silver tequila that may be flavored with caramel coloring, oak extract, glycerin, or sugar-based syrup. Could also be the result of blending silver tequila with aged or extra-aged tequila.  
- Reposado [repoˈsaðo] ("rested"): aged a minimum of two months, but less than a year in oak barrels of any size  
- Añejo [aˈɲexo] ("aged" or "vintage"): aged a minimum of one year, but less than three years in small oak barrels  
- Extra Añejo ("extra aged" or "ultra aged"): aged a minimum of three years in oak barrels, this category was established in March 2006.  

With 100% agave tequila, blanco or plata is harsher with the bold flavors of the distilled agave up front, while reposado and añejo are smoother, subtler, and more complex. As with other spirits aged in casks, tequila takes on the flavors of the wood, while the harshness of the alcohol mellows. The major flavor distinction with 100% agave tequila is the base ingredient, which is more vegetal than grain spirits (and often more complex).

## Notes
- 我蠻糾結要不要加購100% DE AGAVE與陳年的龍舌蘭的……買過一瓶廉價的BLANCO龍舌蘭，說實話吧那不算我很喜歡的味道，做的酒也不是很喜歡。有些擔心我覺得它不好喝不是因為它品質低，而是因為我確實不喜歡龍舌蘭的味道，那樣的話買陳年或高純度的龍舌蘭不會更受不了嗎？
